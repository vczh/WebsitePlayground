                Here are dependencies of the source code.
                Each box means a set of .h and .cpp file.
                For example, <b>Vlpp</b> means <b>Vlpp.h</b> and <b>Vlpp.cpp</b>.

                Source code can be found in the <b>Import</b> folder.

                    These files are basic C++ constructions.
                    GacUI is built on these libraries.
                    In most of the cases,
                    you only need functions and classes from <b>Vlpp</b> and <b>VlppOs</b>.

                <p>
                    This file contains a very thin library for generated C++ code from <b>the Workflow script language</b>.
                    UI elements of GacUI are recommended to create from XML.
                    All resource files will be compiled to the Workflow script language first,
                    and then generate C++ code from these scripts.
                    You need this file to run your UI.

                    <b>Usually you don't need these files.</b>
                    <b>VlppWorkflowRuntime</b> contains virtual machine to run the Workflow script language directly.
                    The runtime can serialize compiled script to a binary file and reload it.
                    If some reflectable C++ classes are used in the script,
                    please make sure all these classes are registered when loading it.
                    <b>VlppWorkflowCompiler</b> contains a compiler for the Workflow script language.

                    This is the GacUI itself.
                    <b>GacUIWindows</b> is the port to Windows OS.
                    Windows older than 7 is not supported.
                    <b>DarkSkin</b> is the default skin.
                    If you have created your own skin for every control,
                    you don't need this file.

                <title>GacUIReflection and DarkSkinReflection</title>
                <p>
                    <b>Usually you don't need these files.</b>
                    These files registered all reflectable classes for GacUI.
                    You only need this when you need to dynamically compiler and execute Workflow script that access GacUI classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually we don't need runtime reflection in this project,
                    so you have to define a empty <b>VCZH_DEBUG_NO_REFLECTION</b> macro using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/d-preprocessor-definition">in preprocessor definitions</a>.
                    You can either to this by updating your project properties,
                    or use the /D compiler option if you are using Visual Studio Code.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>When you don't need reflection</b>,
                            don't link these files,
                            and you must add <b>VCZH_DEBUG_NO_REFLECTION</b>.
                            You will save about 20 megabytes in the executable file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>When you need reflection</b>,
                            link these files,
                            and you must not add <b>VCZH_DEBUG_NO_REFLECTION</b>.

                    <b>Usually you don't need these files.</b>
                    This is the GacUI XML resource compiler.
                    <b>GacGen32.exe</b> and <b>GacGen64.exe</b> are the executable version of this file.
