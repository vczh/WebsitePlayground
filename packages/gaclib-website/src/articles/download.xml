            <p>
                Here are dependencies of the source code.
                Each box means a pair of .h and .cpp file.
                For example, <b>Vlpp</b> means <b>Vlpp.h</b> and <b>Vlpp.cpp</b>.

                    These files are basic C++ constructions.
                    GacUI is built on these libraries.
                    In most of the cases,
                    you only need functions and classes from <b>Vlpp</b> and <b>VlppOs</b>.

                <p>
                    This file contains a very thin library for generated C++ code from <b>the Workflow script language</b>.
                    UI elements of GacUI are recommended to create from XML.
                    All resource files will be compiled to the Workflow script language first,
                    and then scripts are generate C++ code from these scripts.
                    You need this file to run your UI.

                    <b>VlppWorkflowRuntime</b> contains virtual machine to run the Workflow script language directly.
                    The runtime can serialize compiled script to a binary file and reload it.
                    If some reflectable C++ classes are used in the script,
                    please make sure all these classes are registered when loading it.
                    <b>VlppWorkflowCompiler</b> contains a compiler for the Workflow script language.

                <p>
                    This is the GacUI itself.
                    <b>GacUIWindows</b> is the port to Windows OS.
                    All Windows older than 7 are not supported.
                    <b>DarkSkin</b> is the default skin.
                    If you have created your own skin for every controls,
                    you don't need this file.

                    These files register all reflectable classes for GacUI.
                    You only need this when you need to dynamically compiler and execute Workflow scripts that access GacUI classes.

                                    You can either to this by updating your project properties,

                    This is the GacUI XML resource compiler.
                    <b>GacGen32.exe</b> and <b>GacGen64.exe</b> are the executable version of this file.

                Tools can be found in the <b>Tools</b> folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only need <b>GacBuild.ps1</b> and <b>GacClear.ps1</b>.
                They required Powershell.
                If crashes happen in the script instead of in executable files,
                you may want to upgrade your Powershell version and try again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that,
                although you only need to run the above 2 script files,
                all files in this folder are required.
